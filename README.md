# Angular-Node
MEAN stack web app


This web app was created to familiarize myself with full stack development. It uses node/express for the backend and angular/bootstrap 
for the frontend. It connects to a mongo database hosted at mlab.com and utilizes rest apis to add/update/delete/get user data.

It also uses passport for authorization on certain http requests to keep them secure.

This main focus was on functionality so styling was not a high priority.
